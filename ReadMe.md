# Workouts App using MERN Stack

This was my very first attempt in learning the actual working of a Fullstack app.

With this project I learnt

- how to create api routes
- Manage Authentication with JWT token generation.
- Connect our backend to MongoDb
- Create Schemas and models.
- How to structure backend code to achieve clean coding.
- Express methodologies and middlewares

Overall a really Fun project to get an overview of working of backend, since I am a front end developer.

Coded along with [Net Ninja](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9g8OhpOZxNdhXggFz2lOuCT&si=swF4UDwyJTwJa-kr) MERN Tutorial.
